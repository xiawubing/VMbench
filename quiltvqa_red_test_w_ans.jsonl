The most important one really that I think of is angiosarcoma, and it's usually in, obviously post-radiation is a really common place for it to arise, and also occasionally in chronic, like 10, 20-year longstanding chronic lymphedema. So that's why lymphedema, aside from being really morbid and uncomfortable for patients, it also has a risk of progression to malignancy, again, because of that probably chronic damage to the lymphatics and vessels over many, many years.

Yeah, my question was, why is the, is this region of the body more prone to this rather than, say, the more dependent areas, like, say, the feet, right? I mean, if you're talking about drainage, why wouldn't the feet show, or why wouldn't the distal extremities show? Well, that's a great question. Why not even further down?

So the nuclei of the adipocytes and the vessels all get a lot closer together than normal, and so it makes it look very cellular and weird.

Some of them are almost starting to look like little signet rings, and occasionally, they can do that, they can have a very signet ring look, and people can think it's signet ring carcinoma or something metastatic. So yeah, the nuclei get close together, you see more pink, a lot of this pink is the cell membrane of the adipocyte cell membrane that's kind of folded over and you're seeing it that's normally pushed out and very thin when we cut it, but now we're cutting through it when we section the tissue, it's cutting through at tangential angles.", "general": 0.0}

But then once you see this, this is an SNX cell carcinoma. And a SNX cell carcinoma can have different cell types, can have these vacillated cells we see in the background, can have also something called intercalated duct cells, which are usually surrounding lumens, like maybe this one. But to call SNX as a tumor, SNX cell carcinoma, you need to see the zymogen granule and the acinar cells, typically is a low grade tumor, but you can have high grade tumor with high grade morphology, similar to adenoid cystic, not adenoid cystic, mucoepidermoid carcinoma is common to see lymphoid stroma, here we see some lymphoid stroma.", "general": 0.0}
